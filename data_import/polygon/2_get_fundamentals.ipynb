    "    * Cash & equivalents (for dilution prediction)\n",
    "    * Cash burn (for dilution prediction, but must be estimated)\n",

    "* Hard to get:\n",
    "    * Free float (outstanding - insider - institutional)\n",

    "* Very hard to get:\n",
    "    * Short interest\n",
    "\n",
    "A list of what I have found:\n",
    "* [Polygon](https://polygon.io/docs/stocks/get_vx_reference_financials): only has EPS, sector and outstanding shares\n",
    "* [Finnhub](https://finnhub.io/docs/api): has all easy to get data, but not for delisted stocks\n",
    "* [FinancialModelingPrep](https://site.financialmodelingprep.com/): has all easy to get. Free float can be calculated as they have insider/institutional holdings and outstanding shares.\n",
    "* [Valueinvesting.io](https://valueinvesting.io/short-interest-api): only has short-interest but nothing else, Either 100 or 400/month.\n",
    "* Compustat: I have access through my university, but not sure if short-interest is available\n",
    "* [Sharadar](https://data.nasdaq.com/search?filters=%5B%22Equities%22%2C%22Fundamentals%22%5D): Listed on the Nasdaq Data Link data market\n",
    "* [Tiingo](https://www.tiingo.com/documentation/)\n",
    "* [IEXCloud](https://iexcloud.io/)\n",
    "* [EODHD](https://eodhd.com/pricing?utm_source=google_search&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=Brand_Europe&roistat_referrer&roistat_pos&roistat=google1_g_124657464434_526148784701_eodhd&gad=1)\n",
    "\n",
    "Since Sharadar has almost everything I want, including data for ADRs, I settle with them. QuantRocket also uses them. I thought they are extremely expensive so I didn't look further. Turns out I am wrong, but it's still stupid you have to create an account just to see the pricing. The bundle for all data is 69/month. And they have a bulk data download endpoint. Although they do not provide float, it can be calculated by subtracting the institutional and insider ownership from the outstanding shares. While this is not 100% correct (e.g. you also have to take into account options, Rule 144 etc.) it is good enough for my purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Almost no one has short interest. I will likely settle with Compustat and Valueinvesting.io for that. However this is not high on my priorities list.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other alternative data that I want are the historical borrowing rates on IBKR. These can be bought on [iborrowdesk.com](https://www.patreon.com/iborrowdesk) for almost free.\n"

    "# Sharadar Core US Fundamentals\n",
    "They offer several subscriptions. They have data for fundamentals (59/month), insiders (25/month), institutional ownership (25/month) and EOD prices (29/month). The bundle that contains these all only costs 69/month. So I might as well pay the 10/month more.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using this API is a little bit different than others. This is because Sharadar sells their data through the Nasdaq Data Link (NDL), so they must use their API. This API must be usable for all vendors, so the API endpoints are very generalized. They have 4 different APIs. The one we need is the 'REST API for tables data' for data product code SF1. \n",
    "\n",
    "Every data set that uses the tables API has different sets of tables. E.g. for Sharadar the tables are SF1, DAILY, TICKERS, INDICATORS, ACTIONS, SP500 and EVENTS. All data is stored in either one of these tables. Then in the API call filters (e.g. <code>ticker='AAPL'</code>) are used to narrow down the selection. The return value is XML, JSON or CSV. The filters available depend on the data set. For SF1 these are ticker, calendardate, lastupdated, dimension and datekey. You can also append the filter with [filter operators](https://docs.data.nasdaq.com/docs/parameters-1), such as <code>.gt</code> to return only the rows with values greater than the specified value. We can also pass several parameters to each call, such as <code>qopts.columns</code> to select which column of the table we want. There are also options to bulk download. \n",
    "\n",
    "The 'dimension' must be a 3-letter combination of (AR, MR) and (Y, T, Q). AR is As-Reported, MR is Most-Recent, Y is for annual data while T is for trailing-12-month and Q is for quarterly. Q is not available for ADRs. The AR is the one that excludes restatements. Sometimes when companies file annual reports, they do not file a quarterly one because that information is already contained in the annual. If a restatement occurs in ART within the 12-month period, that datapoint is restated.\n",
    "\n",
    "Which one do we need? The best point-in-time information is ART. We definitely need As-Reported. Also a trailing-12-month figure makes more sense. If we did not use 12-month trailing we would use either quarterly (which has no information about the previous 3 months) or annual (which has no information of the most recent months unless we query by January). ART *does* include restatements, but only if it was available within the 12-month period. We want restatements, but not those that we would not have access to at that point in time. So ART is the best choice.\n",
    "\n",
    "So the goal is: build a fundamental database for as many tickers as possible in our <code>tickers_v3</code> ticker list (excluding ETF and ETNs). This database has a quarterly frequency which contains the information of the last 12 months. Except for ADRs because they do not file annually. We do not need all ratio's, just a few. Some data is non-changing, such as the country or sector, which will be added to our ticker list to create <code>tickers_v4</code>. Some data updates more frequently than once per quarter. These are the ratios that depend on price such as P/B ratio. For these we only store the non-price (B) part. Then at backtesting the true value is calculated using the *forward adjusted* price from every data point. For ADRs some values are in USD, other not. Yes this is annoying.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will add to <code>tickers_v4</code>:\n",
    "* Sector (not the SIC sector)\n",
    "* Industry\n",
    "* Country\n",
    "\n",
    "We will add to <code>raw/fundamentals/AAA.csv</code>:\n",
    "* date: datekey: Date of availability (date)\n",
    "* weighted_shares_outstanding: shareswa: Weighted average shares (int) (to get market cap)\n",
    "\n",
    "* cash: cashnequsd : Cash and Equivalents (USD)\n",
    "* change in cash: cashnequsd / previous cashnequ\n",
    "* current_ratio: currentratio : Short term assets/liabilities (ratio). Higher is better.\n",
    "\n",
    "* div_ps: dps: Dividends per share (USD/share)\n",
    "* earnings_ps: epsusd : to calculate P/E (USD)\n",
    "* book_ps: bvps/fxusd: book value per share (may not be USD) converted to USD\n",
    "* sales_ps : sps: sales per share (USD)\n",
    "* net_margin: netmargin: Net margin (ratio)\n",
    "\n",
    "Other data we want:\n",
    "* S&P500 constituents in <code>raw/SP500.csv</code>. They do not have other indices. But for the other ones we can just construct them ourselves. Some are also mechanical unlike the S&P500.\n",
    "\n",
    "This list is quite short. But it is enough to work with. We can easily add more if we want. We also have to take into account splits... The earnings per share gets halved with a 1-to-2 split. But some ratios stay the same such as the current ratio.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also we will save the entire database just in case we need it later.\n",
    "\n",
    "To not have to deal with naked API requests, we use the their official [SDK](https://github.com/Nasdaq/data-link-python/#local-api-key-environment-variable). Read their [quickstart guide](https://github.com/Nasdaq/data-link-python/blob/main/FOR_ANALYSTS.md) and [detailed guide](https://github.com/Nasdaq/data-link-python/blob/main/FOR_DEVELOPERS.md). It is really confusing what the difference between <code>get</code>, <code>get_table</code>, <code>DataSet</code>, <code>DataTable</code> and <code>DataBase</code> is. I will just follow the [examples](https://data.nasdaq.com/databases/SF1/documentation) and use <code>get_table</code>."
