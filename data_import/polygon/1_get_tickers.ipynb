    "# Building a stock database using Polygon\n",
    "The goal is to create a financial database of 1-minute OHLCV data from 2005 and beyond, delisted or listed, for common stocks and ADR common stocks. Including fundamental and adjustment data. I use Polygon for price data. It is actually very annoying to get a survivorship-bias free database. Some vendors do not have delisted stocks at all, while some only have them when the ticker is not re-used. But Polygon does not have all I want, their fundamental data is lacking. While you can get earnings data you cannot query cash (for dilution prediction) and (short) float. I am still searching for a solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "With the Alpaca notebooks (which are now in the archive) I tried to convert tick quote data to quotes and then merge them with bars to get a realistic bid-ask spread. I have decided to not use quote data anymore. It is simply too expensive, cumbersome or simply impossible. I would have to download ALL tick data in order to get quotebars. Instead, I will just trade using 1-minute OHLC. When backtesting, I will assume a spread of 1 tick or a few cents. This is okay, because I simply will not trade HFT or systems with an average profit less than 0.3% for liquid stocks or less than 0.1% for liquid futures/CFDs. I also will avoid illiquid stocks. If I want a more realistic estimate, I will sample the bid-ask spread throughout the day. \n",
    "\n",
    "All Polygon data will be stored in <code>../../../data/polygon/</code>. This map contains a <code>raw</code> and <code>processed</code> folder. The <code>raw</code> folder will contain the folders <code>m1</code>, <code>adjustments</code>, <code>fundamentals</code> and <code>tickers</code>. And a file called <code>tickers_v{version}.csv</code>, which are the list of tickers. The second version is 'cleaned', the third version includes ETFs and the fourth version includes the start/end dates of the price data available in *our* database. The <code>processed</code> folder will contain the folders <code>m1</code>, <code>m5</code>, <code>h1</code>, <code>d1</code>, <code>w1</code>, <code>m1</code>, <code>fundamentals</code> and <code>tickers.csv</code>. Processed data is always adjusted. Raw data is never. Some other data, such as market hours that are not specific to a data vendor, are stored in <code>../../../data/other/</code>. The folders have to be created manually.\n",
    "\n",
    "(For live trading I will not pay $200/month to Polygon just for real-time data. I will use IBKR for real-time, Polygon for historic, another source for fundamentals historic and another source for realtime fundamentals.)\n",
    "\n",
    "The series of notebooks:\n",
    "1. **[done]** Get a list of tickers and market hours. This is way much more difficult than expected. \n",
    "2. Get fundamentals (limited).\n",
    "3. **[done]** Get adjustment factors.\n",
    "4. Download raw 1-minute OHLC data. Raw price data contains <code>[\"datetime\", \"open\", \"high\", \"low\", \"close\", \"vwap\", \"trades\", \"volume\", \"otc\"]</code>. The <code>datetime</code> column is the converted Unix timestamp from the original raw data. The <code>trades</code> column is the amount of trades in the minute and <code>otc</code> is a flag whether the asset is traded OTC. I will not trade OTCs yet. Higher resolutions are not downloaded, but aggregated later. Raw data is never deleted or modified.\n",
    "5. Clean suspicious bars with quote/tick data.\n",
    "6. Process data. When data is downloaded for the first time or updated, the *entire* data set needs be processed (for the updated tickers). This is because if new adjustments come in due to dividend or split data, the entire history needs to be readjusted. Processed data will contain the columns <code>[\"open\", \"high\", \"low\", \"close\", \"close_original\", \"volume\", \"tradeable\", \"cleaned\", \"halted\"]</code>. All prices are adjusted, except <code>close_original</code>. The reason we need the original close price is for price filters. Processed data should have no gaps. If data is forward filled, the backtester should not trade these 'stale' prices. Either there have been no trades in the minute or the stock is halted. That is what the <code>tradeable</code> flag is for. The <code>cleaned</code> flag is for if the bar has been cleaned. \n",
    "7. Aggregate processed minute bars to higher timeframes. The daily timeframes and higher do not contain extended hours.\n",
    "8. Get index constituents. \n",
    "9. Scraping data. Some fundamentals (like short interest) are very hard to get. But the live value is very easy. So I want to look into scraping this info from free websites.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Note: a data point at 15:59 with OHLC means that the open was at 15:59:00 and close at 16:00:00. So daily data does not contain the 16:00:00 minute bar. My polygon key is in <code>../../../data/polygon/secret.txt</code>, this file has to be created manually, just like the folders.*\n",
    "\n",
    "*Warning: This is much more work than you think it is. Even though we use easy APIs for both price and fundamental data.*"

The only way to get the start date of the META or FB is also to loop, but then to track when the ticker appears. Or use the <code>Ticker Events</code> however this only works for current tickers and not delisted ones. So information actually gets lost in the <code>Tickers</code> endpoint.\n",

If the same ticker had different stocks, they are merged when downloading data which we do not want. So we **must** specify a precise start and end date for each stock, else we might get merging from different stocks. And it is not possible to get the start and end dates from <code>list_tickers</code>. Because it simply does not contain the start date. And also not the renamed tickers.\n",

Looking at the code, in the \"register delisted stocks\", if there is a difference between tickers_all and tickers_update, they are treated as delisting and the end_date is updated. However this is even happens when we have already taken care of the delisting. E.g. In the loop we are at day 2. FB is gone so end_date is set at day 1. We go to day 3. However update_data of course does not contain FB but out ticker list does. So we need to make sure to only compare the active stocks of tickers_all to update_all. In the code it is already fixed."

When we take a look it seems that it happens a lot that the name/cik/composite_figi gets changed, even though it is the same company and ticker. For example for ZWS the name is \"Zurn Water Solutions Corporation\" on 2022-07-01 but on the next trading day (4th July was a stock holiday) the name changes to \"Zurn Elkay Water Solutions Corporation\". We could fix this at the end by merging the csv's, but since this is a regular occurence we will fix it now. The reason why we do name changes at the end, is because tickers_all should represent the point-in-time ticker and correspond to the correct ticker when downloading from Polygon.

    "Some stocks have a 'ghost' day just before their IPO. E.g. YGF was IPO'd on 2023-03-28. But on 2023-03-24 had a entry with start_date and end_date of just one day. This is the same with VCIG, which had 2 'ghost' days on 2023-03-22 and 2023-04-06. For SXTP, the ghost days were actually two. If we investigate all tickers (not necessarily duplicated) that only have 1 day, we see a lot of funds. It looks like a fund is listed for 1 day and then dissappears. (There shouldn't even be funds at all. Looks like they were in tickers_list for 1 day, then Polygon deleted them from the common stocks.) Nevertheless, if start_date is equal to end_date, it's always unusable and something is wrong. So we will first remove all tickers that only exist for one day.\n",

If you want to remove them now, the code is above. It checks if there exists daily data. Then removes the empty entries from our ticker list and updates start_date and end_date. The reason why we postpone this is because it gets very difficult to manage if we want to update data on a cheaper subscription."

    "We need to make sure the code is 'update-proof', because we either cannot download everything, or it is simply inefficient. The scenario is this: you spend a few months on the 200/month plan and download/test as much as you can. You have created a database of 15 years. Then, you only want updates and switch to the 30/month plan. But this plan only has access to the last 5 years instead of 15 years. So for certain parts, you simply cannot download it all again. (Sidenote: for cleaning data you need quote/tick data on the most expensive plan. If you switch to the cheap plan your data will not be cleaned. Or at least not to the same quality. You could e.g. just remove the suspicious bar, so not too much of an issue.)\n",
    "\n",
    "The steps for updating:\n",
    "1. Run the first cells to import the libraries\n",
    "2. Run the cell below.\n",
    "3. Updating <code>market_hours.csv</code>: Run the cell with ### at section 1.2. Make sure the hard-coded <code>early_closes</code> variable is complete.\n",
    "4. Updating all raw ticker lists in the map <code>tickers</code>: Run the 3 cells with ### in section 1.3.\n",
    "5. Updating <code>descriptive.csv</code> (this is the 'dirty' list): Run the first cell with ### in section 1.4.\n",
    "6. Updating <code>descriptive_v2.csv</code>: Run the cells with ### in section 1.5 and 1.6.\n",
    "7. To get <code>descriptive_v3.csv</code>, Run the cells with ### in section 1.7. This only uses the last year of data so not an issue.\n",
